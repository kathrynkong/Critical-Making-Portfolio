# My Art Endeavors

## My Reflection on the Critical Making Class

Upon encountering "critical making" for the first time, I was intrigued yet confused by the first assignment of translating "selfie" into tangible forms, thereby blending creativity, physicality, and conceptual exploration. This semester's journey has underscored the importance of embracing non-textual research outputs in digital humanities, especially those that evoke emotional responses. 

Reflecting on my journey through this course, I realize that I've ventured into new and uncharted territories in the past. I challenged myself by trying activities that I once believed were beyond my abilities. For instance, I experimented with drawing comics, a skill I previously considered myself lacking in. Additionally, I embarked on the endeavor of creating games entirely on my own. Exploring fandom through the "Grammar" work provided me with a fresh perspective, introducing me to platforms like "Archive of Our Own" through others' contributions. Furthermore, I thoroughly enjoyed engaging with AI, dedicating substantial time to crafting a comprehensive piece, which I am now thinking about developing into a paper.

This journey has sparked within me a newfound sense of artistic vibe.
